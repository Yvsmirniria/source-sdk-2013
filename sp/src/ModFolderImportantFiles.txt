These are the files from the ep2_mobility package that you would need to add to your mod's base.

You can put these bin files in your own mod without needing to build source code. Just make sure
gameinfo.txt has the gamebin path setup correctly. If you're using Mobility Mod source code in 
your own source, then obviously you would build your own binaries. 
bin/client.dll
bin/server.dll
